I do the task a little differently than in CodeWars so you can see the result here in the html file

Task:
"Write a function that accepts two arguments and returns the remainder after dividing the larger number by the smaller number.

Division by zero should return NaN. (
Example

remainder(17, 5) -> 2
remainder(13, 72) -> remainder(72,13) -> 7 (The larger number should divide the smaller number)
remainder(1, 0) -> NaN (Division by 0)
remainder(0, 0) -> NaN (Divison by 0)

Input

Arguments will both be integers: positive, negative, or neutral (0)
